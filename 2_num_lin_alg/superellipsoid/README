Superellipsoid movie
====================
This directory indulges Chris's slightly irrational obsession with
superellipsoids, given by the unit ball in the 4-norm,

x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1.

This makes use of POV-Ray (www.povray.org) a freely available ray-tracing
program. POV-Ray is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and makes use of a
simple scripting language to describe a scene for rendering. It is well-suited
to high quality scientific visualization, since it is possible to take
simulation output and convert it into POV-Ray input files.

Single superellipsoid
=====================
The file super.pov describes a single superellipsoid. This makes use POV-Ray's
"polynomial" object, which allows the unit ball equation above to be directly
specified. To render the scene, type

povray +W800 +H600 -J +A0.1 +R3 +Osuper.png super.pov

The first two options give the size of the image as 800x600. The next three
control the rendering quality using oversampling and anti-aliasing. This
command will produce a PNG image super.png of the superellipsoid.

Superellipsoid movie
====================
To make a movie, one can run POV-Ray on a sequence of input scripts with minor
tweaks to generate an image sequence. The Perl script movie.pl reads in the
POV-Ray template s_template.pov and creates a temporary rendering file
render.pov with several key values "AAA", "BBB", ... replaced with varying
parameters. Typing

./movie.pl

will run POV-Ray on a sequence of temporary files to make the movie frames. By
default, the script is set to create a small set of low-quality frames, but
it can be adjusted to increase quality.

Making a movie
==============
Once the script is run, it is necessary to convert the image sequence into a
movie file. Unfortunately, there are no ubiquitous standards for easily
creating high-quality, high-compression movies, and there are a number of
different tools available that depend on your platform:

- On the Mac, the package qt_tools (http://dvb.omino.com/sw/qt_tools/)
  provides a command-line interface to Apple's own QuickTime libraries.

- FFMPEG (https://www.ffmpeg.org) is a good open-source solution that is an
  attractive choice on Linux.

- On Windows, the VirtualDub utility is good for making movies
  (http://virtualdub.org).
