Unit 1: Data Fitting
====================
vander_cond.txt - a transcript of an interactive Python session using NumPy to
evaluate the condition number of several different Vandermonde matrices

v_inter.py - a Python program to do Vandermonde polynomial interpolation,
outputting the results and error to text, which can be reading by other
plotting programs such as Gnuplot (www.gnuplot.info). If the program is run
with "python v_inter.py >out" so that the data is sent to a file called "out",
then within Gnuplot the results can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:3 t 'Reference curve', 'out' u 1:2 t 'Polynomial fit'

The differences between the two can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:4 t 'Interpolation differences'

v_inter2.py - a second version of v_inter.py that uses Matplotlib to plot the
results directly withing Python

ch_int.py - a Python program to perform Lagrange interpolation using Chebyshev
or linearly-spaced points
