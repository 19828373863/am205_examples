Harvard Applied Math 205: Code examples
=======================================
Harvard AM205 is a graduate course the provides a broad overview of scientific
computing. See the main website here:

http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am205/

This Git repository contains example codes from the course. The codes are
primarily written in Python, and make use of several commonly-used libraries

- NumPy for numerical linear algebra (www.numpy.org)
- SciPy for scientific routines and algorithms (www.scipy.org)
- Matplotlib for graphing and visualization (matplotlib.org)

Organization
============
The course is divided into six units:

- Unit 0: Overview of Scientific Computing
- Unit 1: Data Fitting
- Unit 2: Numerical Linear Algebra
- Unit 3: Numerical Calculus and Differential Equations
- Unit 4: Nonlinear Equations and Optimization
- Unit 5: Eigenvalue Problems

Example codes from each unit are provided in separate directories.
